I packed my gear and hiked to the west end of Lake Catherine where I took some photos and left my big back pack behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hike up to the top was rather straightforward and relatively flat compare to both Banner and Ritter. It was mostly just long with a few ups and downs but nothing major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6236262-1.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt. Davis"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Banner and Ritter from the top of Mt. Davis The route is basically straight towards Ritter on snow.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found the summit register and was the first ascent of the summer, the entries went all of the way to 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took some pictures and then headed back to where I had dropped my large backpack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6236263.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt.

Rogers and Lyell Peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip back to North Glacier pass was uneventful and I put my big pack on and headed down the pass to the North Fork of San Joaquin River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6236572.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt.

Rogers in the morning. Going down in places was slightly hairy and and slid at least once. It was again fairly flat although I was really exhausted by the time I set up camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6236592.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt.

Now I was back with better gear and a better idea of the route. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got up at around midnight, grabbed my stuff and headed out. I went around Lake Catherine on the north side and then up past the Ritter lakes. I found this Lyell salamander, just hanging out on top of the snow, which I found interesting since it was well below freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225637.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt. Ritter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lyell Salamander&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I passed my previous campsite, the snow appeared to be 10 to 15 feet deep based on my remembrance of how it looked without the snow. I made it past the lakes and then started up the west side of Mt. Ritter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I passed the spot where I had turned around on my previous attempt and continued up a small snow-filled couloir. It was steep enough to require front pointing with my crampons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225639.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt. Ritter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking to the west from the couloir&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ascending to the top of the couloir, I had to take my crampons off and go up a boulder field and then traverse back to the left to get over the top of the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225641.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt. Ritter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The traverse to the left after the couloir.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once over the top of the ridge I was back on snow and headed up to the peak. I had to again remove my crampons just before the summit and scramble up boulder to the top where I found the register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225643.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt.

Clark is on the far right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I headed back down to the saddle and then made the traverse across the boulder field again.  However, this time instead of going down couloir  at the top of the bowl as I had on my way up, I traversed farther climber's right and then headed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually the snow narrowed to about 6-8 feet wide and zigged zagged between the rocks. At this point I turned around and backed down the snow, just as I had done when descending &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-5-the-ascent/"&gt;Gannet Peak in Wyoming the summer before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it down to the Ritter lakes and then back around  Lake Catherine to my camp at around where I crawled underneath my tarp and took a nap. It threatened to storm but never actually did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6226260.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Mt.

I stopped about halfway to the top of the North Glacier pass and had some more to eat and stopped to take some pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215225.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Banner Peak"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking up North Glacier Pass&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215223.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Banner Peak"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking back down the pass to where I had camped the night before&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it over the top off the pass and dropped off my sleeping bag and other gear. I headed up towards the saddle between Banner Peak and Mt. Ritter staying above Lake Catherine on the east side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of that was pretty easy going, but I crossed too high and had to drop down to the glacier that comes from the saddle. That was hard and there were a couple of mini bergschrunds to be avoided on the way down to the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there it was an easy walk up to the top of the saddle on the glacier, while I could see cracks in the glacier on the side next to Mt. Ritter, there were no cracks or crevasses on the Banner Peak side and it was fairly flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the saddle it was a boulder field with a little bit of scrambling to the top of Banner Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215389.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Banner Peak"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt.

Lyell and Davis Peak from left to right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could not find the register, so I headed down shortly. I went back down to the saddle and then down the glacier, being more careful about where I headed across top the north to my campsite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215430.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Banner Peak"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The saddle from camp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I setup my tarp with some rocks and my trekking poles and took a nap.

The Lee Vining newspaper said that it was due to restrictions because of the dams nearness to a fault line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there I went all the way around the northern side of Gem Lake, crossing Crest Creek  on a log bridge and then reaching the bridge over Rush Creek where I decided to sit down and have breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204593.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Hiking into Thousand Island Lake"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rush Creek&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until this point the trail had been easy to follow, at this point I put on my snow boots and followed the trail as best I could, and eventually I lost the trail and had to head across country. I was finally able to see Ritter and Banner and Glacier Pass from the ridge, right before crossing the Pacific Crest Trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204699.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Hiking into Thousand Island Lake"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt. Ritter, Banner Peak, North Glacier Pass and Mt. Davis from the east.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the ridge there was more cross country travel until I was able to find the trail and stay on it. I got to the north east side of Thousand Island Lake and hiked along the north side towards the pass. The sun cups were atrocious, and made for very had going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204704.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Hiking into Thousand Island Lake"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking towards North Glacier Pass from the Thousand Island Lake, notice the sun cups.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it to the end of the lake and started up the  pass. By this point it was starting to get dark and I was worn out from the suncups, so I set up camp on some dry rocks that were sticking up out of the snow next to some trees. I saw a weasel and took some pictures before getting to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204909.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="North Glacier Pass Peakbagging - Hiking into Thousand Island Lake"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sun going down over Thousand Island Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/north-glacier-pass-peakbagging-banner-peak/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Climbing Mt.

Before I got to the top of the pass, I took a right up a snow covered coulour. I made it about halfway up before crampons were necessary, and while it was not very steep, they made a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached the top and found the summit register, which was an old ammunition box that had been placed by some navy guys from one of the bases in Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6173782.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Mt.

Dana and found the summit register, it was a PVC pipe that I was unable to open. I met a couple of skiers who had skinned to the top from the north of the peak, paused for more pictures and then headed back down the snowy ridge, which was not steep enough to glissade unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6174405.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Mt.

Gibbs rather than trying to go up and over the top. On the south side of Mt. Gibbs I saw some Bighorn sheep and again saw the miners cabins at the pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was getting to be dark as I started down the pass, and when I crossed the snow bridge over the creek it gave way underneath of my weight. There was enough snow that I didn't end up in the water, but it was still an unsettling experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached my camp at Walker lake around midnight and took the next day off to rest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Hiking Mono Pass</title><description>After doing Boundary Peak in Nevada, I headed into California and because the road over Tioga Pass was closed, had to adjust my plans.</description><link>http://localhost:2368/hiking-mono-pass/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c7c5a0d11f98707d0f311b7</guid><category>2017 Adventure</category><dc:creator>Charlie Brumbaugh</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 23:13:13 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6153677.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6153677.JPG" alt="Hiking Mono Pass"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After doing&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/climbing-boundary-peak-nevada/"&gt; Boundary Peak in Nevad&lt;/a&gt;a, I headed into California and because the road over Tioga Pass was closed, had to adjust my plans. I was thinking about hiking in the Sierras from the west side, but decided that I would try some hikes on the east side instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drove up towards Walker lake and setup camp, before heading out on a hike around 10:00 am or so. The road was in bad shape with lots of bumps and ruts and I pulled off at a campsite before the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hiked up to Walker lake and from there up Mono pass. Parts of the trail were very snow covered  and I had to cross the creek on a snow bridge. I reached the lake at the top of the pass and had lunch. Then I continued all of the way through the pass to other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6153676.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking Mono Pass"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I was inside of Yosemite National Park, there were a few old mining cabins and traces of mining from the early 1900's. I could see lots of snow covered mountains in the distance,  some of which I would climb on a different trip several weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6153680.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking Mono Pass"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hike out was rather uneventful and I spent the next day as a rest day.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Climbing Boundary Peak - Nevada</title><description>At the top I though about going down the boundary saddle and doing the peak in California, but didn't feel up to it so I took some more pictures and then headed down. </description><link>http://localhost:2368/climbing-boundary-peak-nevada/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c7c527111f98707d0f3119a</guid><category>Peak Ascents</category><category>2017 Adventure</category><dc:creator>Charlie Brumbaugh</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 22:28:53 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6143294-1.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6143294-1.JPG" alt="Climbing Boundary Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Tonopah  Nevada, I headed west on Highway 95 and then High 6 until just before the border with California.  I pulled over on the side of the road and slept in my vehicle as it was getting dark and I wasn't sure what dirt road to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning I headed up the Queen Canyon dirt road, until I found a place to pull over and camp. I spent the day resting and preparing my gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I headed up the road and passed all of the old mining cabins and trails until I got to the top of the pass. By this time it was sleeting and windy and getting cold. I went just over the top of the pass and ended up sleeping under a juniper tree in the most level spot that I could find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next morning I headed down the other side of the pass, trying to find a way to hike to the south. I wasn't feeling very good at all, so I ended up camping out underneath some trees and just sleeping basically the whole day. Eventually I decided to hike back up the top of the pass and camp there. I was going to try to hike down the White Mountains, but decided to settle for only hiking Boundary Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it to the top of the pass and set up camp, taking the time for a photograph looking north,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6132961.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Boundary Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking north from the Boundary Peak Trailhead&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;and more looking up towards Boundary Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6132963.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Boundary Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking up towards Boundary Peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could see that the trail was well maintained, even though the trail register was showing signs of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning I got up early and began the process of hiking up the trail in the dark, the trail made it easy going and the sunrise made a beautiful effect on the peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6143271-1.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Boundary Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Moon at sunrise over boundary peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hiked west until I reached the saddle on the north side, where I put on my mountaineering boots and began the ascent proper. It was fairly easy going, lots of scree and the trail no longer existed but it wasn't horrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were sections on the top where the snow was several feet deep and there were large boulders to climb through but I never needed my crampons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top I though about going down the boundary saddle and doing the peak in California,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6143446.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Boundary Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking southwest from Boundary Peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;but didn't feel up to it so I took some more pictures and then headed down. The summit register had all sorts of funny entries and had lots of names since it is the highest point (as compared to the &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/climbing-wheeler-peak/"&gt;highest peak Mt. Wheeler&lt;/a&gt;) in Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6143674.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Boundary Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Selfie at the top of Boundary Peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I passed several climbers on the way down, and found out from them that the road over Tioga pass into Yosemite was closed. I hiked back to camp at the trail head and from there back down the road until I reached my truck. I packed up and headed into California, sleeping next to my truck at Mono Lake.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After visiting Zion National Park, drove to Cedar City and slept in the Walmart parking lot before heading west to Great Basin National Park.

I stopped in at the visitor center, saw the rifle that had been found leaning against a tree for over a hundred years and while the Park does not require any permits, I did fill out an plan with  the park staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there I drove up to the trailhead and parked, there was basically no one else and the roads to the upper campgrounds were still snowed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5180001.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there I organized my gear, loaded my backpack and hiked up the trail to the upper campground as that was as close as I could camp. The hike up was rather uneventful, there were a couple of French tourists and some birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5180015.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set up camp underneath a picnic table, it made it easy to put my tarp over me and was one of the few places where the ground was both flat and dry. I had a dinner of boiled hotdogs and then crawled into my sleeping bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up shortly after midnight and began hiking up the mountain. It was dark and the snow was frozen solid, I lost the trail once but was quickly back on track. On my way up and across the first big ridge, I slipped and whacked the back of my leg with my crampons and tore my snow pants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before sunrise I was making my way up the peak itself, but a lenticular cloud formed on top of the peak and the wind really picked up. I tried to continue, but the wind and snow was too rough and so I turned round and headed back down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5190111.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the peak was completely socked in, although it did clear off later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hiked all the way back to camp and took a nap then just hung out for the rest of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got up again right after midnight, put my gear on and headed back up the mountain. It was easier this time because I could follow my tracks from the day before, and it was not nearly so windy. I passed the point where I had turned around the day before and followed the snowed in switchbacks up. At the base of the summit block, I pulled out my ice axe, it was steep enough that I was going to need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could see a few tracks preceding me from a while back, but otherwise it was snow covered. At about this point I started getting altitude sickness, my head was hurting and I was feeling nauseous. I stopped and  had some water, my bottle had a thick layer of ice all round the inside, but there was still some left unfrozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally made it to the top, dug a small hole with my ice axe and waited for the sun to come up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5200135.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watched the sunrise and how it slowly lit up the mountain range to  the south before heading back down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5200136.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going down, I could see Bald Peak in the distance, and since it wasn't too far out of my way, I decided to climb it before I went back camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the top of Bald Peak there was a frosted in weather station and great views of Wheeler Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5200163.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back towards Wheeler Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5200468.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there I headed back towards Mt. Wheeler into the valley and from there back to  camp. I decided to head out that day, so I packed up and hiked out passing more hikers and trees that had been carved many years ago by sheepherders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5200476.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it back to my truck and drove down the mountain, stopping in at the museum and then driving west on the highway until I got to a campground where I saw a bullsnake and watched the sun set on the peaks I had climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/02/P5200477.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Climbing Wheeler Peak - Nevada"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Gannet Peak - Day 8 - Visiting the Bomber Wreck</title><description>The last day of the the trip I hiked to the wreck of a B-24 that had crashed while on a training mission during the Second World War.</description><link>http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-8-visiting-the-bomber-wreck/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c4e82f4a28b4607dcc832e5</guid><category>Gannet Peak</category><dc:creator>Charlie Brumbaugh</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 04:21:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8133755-1.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8133755-1.JPG" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 8 - Visiting the Bomber Wreck"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day of the the trip I hiked to the wreck of a B-24 that had crashed while on a training mission during the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail was broken in places and I had to cross a marsh and then go through a thick patch of woods before I reached it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was aluminum scatted all over and it was possible to see where the fire from the crash had melted it into pools.

It seemed like the way to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before treeline, I passed two parties, the first making noise with their bear bells and carrying bear spray, while the in the second, they all had large revolvers. It was quite an interesting contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it back down the switchbacks and then turned left up the canyon because I wanted to see the B-24 wreck the next day.

It was dark and before I got very far it started sleeting and there were no stars to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided the extra risk of slipping wasn't worth it, so I went back through the boulder field to camp and got back into my sleeping bag. At approximately 4:00 am, I was awoken by a party of three starting out and the older couple getting ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked up, the stars were out so I decided that it was a go. I hurriedly reorganized my stuff and headed back up through the boulder field. I reached the snow just as it was getting light and put my mountaineering boots and crampons on. There was some hard ice and more snow, before another section of rock to reach the Gooseneck Glacier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8102413.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 5 - The Ascent"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking up towards the Gooseneck, the rock feature for which the glacier is named.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traverse over to the bergschrund was pretty level and there was even a path worn into the snow from the previous climbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8102422.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 5 - The Ascent"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking towards the summit, I would go forward before ascending the bergschrund to the left.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the actual bergschrund crossing was kinda hairy, because there were two major cracks, mandating that one go up, then traverse to the left above the crack, go up again, then traverse right back over the top of the first crack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I was at the top of the chute, the snow ran out and I stashed my crampons. From there it was a pretty straight forward climb up the ridge to the summit, with no major hurdles and plenty of wide ledges to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once at the summit I found the summit register and stopped to take photos. I could see all of the ways to the Tetons, while to the south the mountain peaks stretched into the far distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8102436.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 5 - The Ascent"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking south from the summit of Gannet Peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started the descent, passing the party of three who had awoken me in the morning and was able to get enough of a cell signal to text my parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going down the ridge was pretty easy, getting down to the Gooseneck chute was not. Once at the chute, I put my crampons back on, and backed down the bergschrund, firmly planting my ice ax with both hands before moving my feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snow was a lot more melted than when I came up, and while going down the bergschrund I crossed paths with the two gentlemen from the day before, as well as the older couple down below while traversing across the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8102823.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 5 - The Ascent"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking north across the Gooseneck Glacier&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once back on the glacier it was just a slow process of going down the rocks and boulders and scree. I finally got back to my camp and took a nap to rest. When I go up, I decided that I wanted to be below timberline in case it rained, so I packed up my gear and headed down the trail. Just before the timberline, I got caught in a small hailstorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it all the way back until the major stream crossing, and the snow melt had raised the water level to an uncross-able degree, so I set up camp and waited till the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliebrumbaugh.github.io/gannet-peak-day-6-out-of-the-canyon/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliebrumbaugh.github.io/gannet-peak-day-4-getting-to-base-camp/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Gannet Peak - Day 4 - Getting to Base Camp</title><description>On Day 4 I woke up, had breakfast and began heading up the trail once more.

I had one serious creek crossing that made me glad that I had gotten up early and not waited till the snow melt made it much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally got above the treeline, and continued up the wide glacial valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8091491.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 4 - Getting to Base Camp"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Just before ascending beyond the treeline.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't too much longer that I turned the corner and was able to see the peaks at the end of the glacially carved valley and the Gooseneck glacier. I hiked all of the way to the end of the trail and set up camp in one of the rock rings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next I took just a daypack and went forward through the boulderfields until I came to one of the small tarns, in order to get a better view of what I would need to climb the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would need to make my way to the base of the Gooseneck, cross the bergschrund and then follow the ridge to the right all the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8091627.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 4 - Getting to Base Camp"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking up towards Gooseneck Glacier and Gannet Peak.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I took a nap, then had a conversation with two other climbers about the route and weather. Later on that day the couple that I had passed the day before arrived and setup camp in one of the nearby rock rings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8092285.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 4 - Getting to Base Camp"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking back down the canyon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took several time lapses, organized my gear, ate well and discovered a bronze plague below the camp where a pioneer's ashes had been scattered. Then I crawled into by sleeping bag and tried to get some sleep for the summit attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliebrumbaugh.github.io/gannet-peak-day-5-the-ascent/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliebrumbaugh.github.io/gannet-peak-day-3-back-on-track/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Gannet Peak - Day 3 - Back on Track</title><description>Since I had gotten lost on Day 2, most of day three was spend retracing my steps and getting back on the right path. </description><link>http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-3-back-on-track/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c3fed646045d00e5b18e2fa</guid><category>Gannet Peak</category><dc:creator>Charlie Brumbaugh</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2019 02:51:18 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8081146.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8081146.JPG" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 3 - Back on Track"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I had gotten lost on Day 2, most of day three was spend retracing my steps and getting back on the right path. I woke up, had my breakfast, tried to go a little farther up the canyon before realizing that I had made the complete wrong turn at the bridge and headed back down the canyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I crossed the bridge at about noon or so and began hiking up the correct canyon, stopping for lunch in an area with burned out trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8081034.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 3 - Back on Track"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Burned out forest along the trail&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I passed the trail intersection that comes from the Wind River Reservation, where an outfitter had set up a tent and had several horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I passed many beautiful meadows and was able to see the Gannet Peak for the very first time of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8081154.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 3 - Back on Track"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking towards Gannet Peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hiked until it was dark, having passed one older couple with external frame backpacks, one single man who was thinking about turning around and a father and son team who did turn around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got to camp and after I was all set up with my tarp, I was startled by a single cow elk that wandered through. I took several time lapses with my camera, and then went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-4-getting-to-base-camp/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-2-wrong-turn/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Gannet Peak - Day 2 - Wrong Turn</title><description>When I woke up, it was overcast and grey and just barely drizzling.

Fortunately, unlike some of my other adventures, I had stayed dry throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got up, retrieved my food from its bear hang, packed my stuff and headed down the trail. I passed several lakes and by midmorning the sky had cleared and it finally warmed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I descended all of the way into the canyon which was less than fun due to all of the weight I was carrying. It was a long ways down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8070888.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 2 - Wrong Turn"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking to the south from switchbacks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found the bridge that was supposed to be damaged and &lt;strong&gt;then I made a mistake. Instead of crossing the bridge, I continued on past up the canyon&lt;/strong&gt;. It was rough going and eventually the trail simply gave out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/P8071011.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Gannet Peak - Day 2 - Wrong Turn"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The riverbed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I still thought that I was on the right path, so I continued up the canyon, following the stream. Eventually, it got dark and at a seemingly dead end, so I set up camp underneath of a rock, with my tarp stretched out at a 45 degree angle to keep the rain off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-3-back-on-track/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-1-beginning/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
