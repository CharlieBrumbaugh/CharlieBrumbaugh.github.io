In the morning I got up and went into Lee Vining to get gas and then headed over Tioga Pass on my way to Bass Lake California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped in Toulume Meadows and then at the parking lot at the top of Tenaya Lake before deciding to park at the trailhead on the downstream side of Tenaya Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to hike a mountain on my way through Yosemite and Cloud's Rest looked like a fun hike that I hadn't done before. I got my gear together and headed down the trail around noon. The stream crossing below the lake was over my knees, if it hadn't been for the submerged stepping stones, it probably would have been over my waist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met a backpacker going the same way and we hiked together and talked for a good while. He had just gotten back from working in the Sudan with Samaritan's Purse and was doing a backpacking trip on his way to a wedding in California. We had both thought about working at the same places (Summit Adventure and SROM) and talked about that and careers and so on. Eventually, he needed to stop and go slower since he was backpacking with lots more gear and I pressed on towards Cloud's Rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail was pretty easy going until I got to the first intersection and then there was a lot more snow on the trail. The trail was well worn through the snow, but still slippery in places. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I got to the final ridge up to Cloud's Rest, the weather started looking nasty, but I decided to press on as it wasn't bad yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached the top around 2:45 and took some quick pictures before the weather forced me off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7061747.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking Cloud's Rest"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking towards Half Dome and Yosemite Valley from Cloud's Rest&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7061753.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking Cloud's Rest"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking south towards the Clark Range.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7061763.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking Cloud's Rest"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Toward the south east&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7061764.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking Cloud's Rest"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking north into Yosemite&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there I headed back to my truck retracing my steps. I met the hiker and we talked briefly before heading on our own paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took some underwater photos in the stream that ran along the trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7061953.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking Cloud's Rest"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Underwater photo of the stream.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed like the snow was had gotten slicker on the way out and going down had much less purchase than going up. However when it came to cross the big stream again, I found a place to cross on logs and didn't have to wade through again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached my truck around 6:30 and headed into Yosemite, I stopped in the Valley and saw Yosemite Falls before heading out of the Valley towards Bass Lake. I made it all of the way out of Yosemite National Park and then slept on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/hike-out-parker-pass-trip/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Hike Out - Parker Pass Trip</title><description>I woke up in the morning and took some more pictures and then prepared for going down the east side of Mt.

The trail was heavily used by horses and I saw a couple deer on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally reached my truck started the process of unpacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/hiking-clouds-rest/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/koip-and-kuna-peaks-parker-pass-trip/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Koip and Kuna Peaks - Parker Pass Trip</title><description>I again got a late start, the weather was nice and I found no reason to get up early.

I started up Koip Peak at around 9:15 and was on the summit about 45 minutes later. From there I wanted to do Kuna Peak so I went down the west Ridge of Koip to the saddle and then across. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the saddle is the wreck of a WWII B-24 that just barely hit the ridge, it wouldn't have had to have flown much higher to clear the mountain. I went past the wreckage and then up and around to the top of Kuna Peak. The hike down to the saddle wasn't bad but the climbing to the top of Kuna had large boulders and the ridge was very narrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found the summit register and signed my name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7041307-1.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Koip and Kuna Peaks - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Blacktop Peak from Kuna Peak with Mt.

Gibbs and Mt. Dana&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could see some more hikers on top of Koip peak and waved to them but they did not make the traverse over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I went back along the ridge and explored the wreckage a bit. My camera battery gave out and so I was limited to my phone camera. Then I went back over the top of Koip Peak and back to camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7041513.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Koip and Kuna Peaks - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Koip Peak from camp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I rested and charged my camera and then decided to packup and head over the top of Parker Peak and Mt. Woods to get as close to my vehicle as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7041515.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Koip and Kuna Peaks - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Parker Peak from camp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So around 5:00 pm I headed up Parker Peak where I stopped for more pictures and then headed towards Mt. Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7041521.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Koip and Kuna Peaks - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt.

Ritter, North Glacer Pass and Mt. Davis from Parker Peak.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going over the top of Mt. Woods, I went down the ridge to the southeast until I got to the place where I looked like I would be able to descend the east side of Mt. Woods. I found a small set of trees and setup up camp among them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7041646.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Koip and Kuna Peaks - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Watching the sunset on the Ritter Range&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From camp I could see the fireworks they were setting off in Mammoth for the Fourth of July.

The switchbacks came next and then I was down in the bottom below Parker Peak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point there was plenty of snow in places, and the stream head to  be crossed as well. I headed northwest up the gently valley until I was fairly close to the Yosemite border and it looked easy enough to reach the west side of Mt. Lewis and follow it to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there it was an pretty easy hike to the top of, no big boulders or snowfields. From the top one could see &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/climbing-mt-gibbs-and-mt-dana/"&gt;Mt. Gibbs and Mt. Dana&lt;/a&gt; and how much the snow had melted since I had climbed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7030581---Copy.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Mt.

It was a short hike to the top, there was a windbreak and the summit register was in a cheap plastic container. I signed it and then headed south along the ridge to Mt. Wood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ridge was pretty easy going it was small rocks and some patches of snow. I did not find the summit register on Mt. Wood but I did find an arrowhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7020569---Copy.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Parker Peak and Mt.

So I got a late start and around 11:30 or so I headed back to Gem Pass and then followed the trail towards Parker Pass. I looked at the stream and thought about how the hike out might go and took a nap under some trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail was all snowed in and pretty rough going, the parts that weren't snow covered with squishy with mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met two hikers coming down the pass at around 6:30 and stopped and talked to them for a little while. They were heading towards Ritter, the trail closure was going to make it harder for them to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At around 7:45 I was finally off the snow and onto the rock switchbacks going up the pass. I found where water was flowing though the boulders and filled by water bottles. I hiked over the top of the pass and setup camp on the north side where I could see the mountains to the north and there was a wind block made of boulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7010269---Copy.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Getting to Parker Pass - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking towards Mono Lake from camp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P7010254---Copy.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Getting to Parker Pass - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking north towards Mt.

I had breakfast and went back down the trail to look for my other shoe, which I found laying on top of the snow not far from camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to do Blacktop Peak, so I hiked up next to Crest Creek all the way to the the southeast side of the peak and gained the summit from there. I was pretty easy going, I just wasn't feeling great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P6300134---Copy---Copy.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Blacktop Peak - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking southwest from Blacktop Peak, Mt.

Through the pass Mt. Gibbs is on the left and Mt.

On my way back across the summit plateau I found remnants from an airplane crash, small pieces of metal and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P6300250.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Blacktop Peak - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Airplane fragment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the summit I then retraced my steps all the way around and then back to camp. I still wasn't feeling very good.

This trip was going to be for the peaks north east of the ones I had just done, and just  south of &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/hiking-mono-pass/"&gt;Mono Pass &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/climbing-mt-gibbs-and-mt-dana/"&gt;Mt. Gibbs and Mt. Dana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail up towards Thousand Island lake that I had just taken was closed because or the risk that the dams along the way would break. While not imminent, the trail was closed out of an abundance of caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started out again from the Silver Lake campground and headed up the trail, past Agnew lake and Gem Lake where I found a headlamp abandoned along the trail. I headed around Gem Lake to where Crest Creek flows into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, I followed the trail to the north, in some places it was washed out and the stream was flowing directly down the trail. Just before Gem Pass, the snow got to the point that I needed my mountaineering boots and instead of going over Gem Pass, I hiked west, staying on the south side of the the east ridge of Blacktop peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/04/P6290034---Copy.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hike In - Parker Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking towards Parker Pass from camp.

I decided to do the unnamed peak (12,526) between Mt. Rodgers and Electra Peak first, and then if there was time, go over and do Electra Peak as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the saddle between Mt. Rodgers and the unamed peak a lot of water was rushing down and cascading over the rocks. I went straight up towards Mt. Rodgers and then climbed across snow to the left. Once into the hanging valley I headed south until I was on the south side of the peak and headed the east ridge to the top. It was hard packed snow and I had to front point with my crampons at times, but it was nowhere as steep as Mt. Ritter had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached the top slightly before sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6257151.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Electra Peak - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking north towards Mt.

Lyell in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the top I went down the east ridge and then glissaded down the slope to the north. I retraced my steps, going back to the north beyond the waterfalls and then back into the valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to start the process of hiking out, so after resting at camp I packed up and headed back for North Glacier Pass. I had forgotten my tripod at the pass after doing Mt. Davis, otherwise I may have crossed the range farther north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was hard going as the snow was melting. I had to put my crampons on with my full backpack to make it up the pass itself and found my tripod just where I left it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6257373.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Electra Peak - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt.

I found a dry spot on a patch of dry ground with some stunted trees providing some shelter.

In the afternoon it stormed and rained and I wasn't certain that I was going to be able to do Electra Peak and the one between it and Mt.

Ritter - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 years before this trip, I had &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/failed-attemp-on-mt-ritter-the-climb/"&gt;tried to climb Mt. Ritter&lt;/a&gt; and failed. Now I was back with better gear and a better idea of the route. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got up at around midnight, grabbed my stuff and headed out. I went around Lake Catherine on the north side and then up past the Ritter lakes. I found this Lyell salamander, just hanging out on top of the snow, which I found interesting since it was well below freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225637.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Mt. Ritter - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lyell Salamander&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I passed my previous campsite, the snow appeared to be 10 to 15 feet deep based on my remembrance of how it looked without the snow. I made it past the lakes and then started up the west side of Mt. Ritter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I passed the spot where I had turned around on my previous attempt and continued up a small snow-filled couloir. It was steep enough to require front pointing with my crampons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225639.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Mt. Ritter - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking to the west from the couloir&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ascending to the top of the couloir, I had to take my crampons off and go up a boulder field and then traverse back to the left to get over the top of the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225641.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Mt. Ritter - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The traverse to the left after the couloir.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once over the top of the ridge I was back on snow and headed up to the peak. I had to again remove my crampons just before the summit and scramble up boulder to the top where I found the register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6225643.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Mt.

Clark is on the far right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I headed back down to the saddle and then made the traverse across the boulder field again.  However, this time instead of going down couloir  at the top of the bowl as I had on my way up, I traversed farther climber's right and then headed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually the snow narrowed to about 6-8 feet wide and zigged zagged between the rocks. At this point I turned around and backed down the snow, just as I had done when descending &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/gannet-peak-day-5-the-ascent/"&gt;Gannet Peak in Wyoming the summer before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it down to the Ritter lakes and then back around  Lake Catherine to my camp at around where I crawled underneath my tarp and took a nap. It threatened to storm but never actually did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6226260.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Mt.

I stopped about halfway to the top of the North Glacier pass and had some more to eat and stopped to take some pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215225.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Banner Peak - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking up North Glacier Pass&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215223.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Banner Peak - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking back down the pass to where I had camped the night before&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it over the top off the pass and dropped off my sleeping bag and other gear. I headed up towards the saddle between Banner Peak and Mt. Ritter staying above Lake Catherine on the east side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of that was pretty easy going, but I crossed too high and had to drop down to the glacier that comes from the saddle. That was hard and there were a couple of mini bergschrunds to be avoided on the way down to the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there it was an easy walk up to the top of the saddle on the glacier, while I could see cracks in the glacier on the side next to Mt. Ritter, there were no cracks or crevasses on the Banner Peak side and it was fairly flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the saddle it was a boulder field with a little bit of scrambling to the top of Banner Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215389.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Banner Peak - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt.

Lyell and Davis Peak from left to right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could not find the register, so I headed down shortly. I went back down to the saddle and then down the glacier, being more careful about where I headed across top the north to my campsite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215430.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Banner Peak - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The saddle from camp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I setup my tarp with some rocks and my trekking poles and took a nap. I took some more pictures and then got my gear ready for climbing Mt. Ritter the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6215634.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Banner Peak - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking through North Glacier Pass to the southwest, Madera Peak is on the far left and Merced on the far right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/north-glacier-pass-trip-mt-ritter/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/north-glacier-pass-thousand-island/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Hiking into Thousand Island Lake - North Glacier Pass Trip</title><description>After a doing Gibbs and Dana, I took a rest day and then got my permit from the Forest Service office at Mono Lake for a one week trip into the Ansel Adams Wilderness to do some peak bagging in the Ritter Range.</description><link>http://localhost:2368/north-glacier-pass-thousand-island/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c8200f4aa6e9707f9ced6f9</guid><category>2017 Adventure</category><category>North Glacier Pass Trip</category><category>Ritter Range</category><dc:creator>Charlie Brumbaugh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 05:59:19 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204705.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204705.JPG" alt="Hiking into Thousand Island Lake - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a doing &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/climbing-mt-gibbs-and-mt-dana/"&gt;Gibbs and Dana&lt;/a&gt;, I took a rest day and then got my permit from the Forest Service office at Mono Lake for a one week trip into the Ansel Adams Wilderness to do some peak bagging in the &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/ritter-range/"&gt;Ritter Range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I parked at the Silver Lake trailhead and headed up past Agnew lake which due to the snowmelt was being emptied by pumps over the top of the dam because the water level was too high. The Lee Vining newspaper said that it was due to restrictions because of the dams nearness to a fault line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there I went all the way around the northern side of Gem Lake, crossing Crest Creek  on a log bridge and then reaching the bridge over Rush Creek where I decided to sit down and have breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204593.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking into Thousand Island Lake - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rush Creek&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until this point the trail had been easy to follow, at this point I put on my snow boots and followed the trail as best I could, and eventually I lost the trail and had to head across country. I was finally able to see Ritter and Banner and Glacier Pass from the ridge, right before crossing the Pacific Crest Trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204699.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking into Thousand Island Lake - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mt. Ritter, Banner Peak, North Glacier Pass and Mt. Davis from the east.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the ridge there was more cross country travel until I was able to find the trail and stay on it. I got to the north east side of Thousand Island Lake and hiked along the north side towards the pass. The sun cups were atrocious, and made for very had going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204704.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking into Thousand Island Lake - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking towards North Glacier Pass from the Thousand Island Lake, notice the sun cups.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made it to the end of the lake and started up the  pass. By this point it was starting to get dark and I was worn out from the suncups, so I set up camp on some dry rocks that were sticking up out of the snow next to some trees. I saw a weasel and took some pictures before getting to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/03/P6204909.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Hiking into Thousand Island Lake - North Glacier Pass Trip"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sun going down over Thousand Island Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/north-glacier-pass-trip-banner-peak/"&gt;Continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/climbing-mt-gibbs-and-mt-dana/"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
