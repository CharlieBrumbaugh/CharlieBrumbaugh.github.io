&lt;p&gt;In the morning I woke and packed a light daypack and headed up the south side of the canyon, scrambling up small boulders and the winding my around until I was out of the canyon, onto the west side of the mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started it was all sagebrush and juniper, as I got higher up, it turned to spruce and aspen on the north side of the ridge, while the south facing side was completely bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw probably 20-30 mountain goats and passed quite a number of trees that had been initialed by sheepherders back in the early 1920-30 which I found rather interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I got out of the trees completely and got to the final leg of the climb where I had to kick steps in the snow in order to ascend. Upon reaching the top, I sent a message with my inReach and took a number of photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way off the peak I was able to glissade for a little bit, and then it was back to slogging through the brush all over again. Instead of going the long way back, I descended directly into the canyon to the south, in order to walk back on the road that went through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw several grouse on the way down and then old mining cabins and tailings on my hike down the road back to my vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get out and do some big adventures and this seemed like an awesome way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, I began in Cheyenne, stocking up on food in Laramie and then driving across Wyoming to Salt Lake city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there I stopped at a park to see and old friend and we hung out and talked for quite a while, not having seen the other in over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I drove south and ended up sleeping in my car in an empty parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

The short version is that in a color image, there are different RGB (Red,Green,Blue) values for each pixel, while in a B&amp;amp;W image the RGB values for each pixel are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the RGB values for a pixel in a color image might be 200,100,50 and if one was to convert it to a red channel B&amp;amp;W, you would set the values of the pixel to 200,200,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the simpler B&amp;amp;W algorithms include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red channel -&amp;gt; Set the blue and green pixels to match the red pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue channel -&amp;gt; Set the red and green pixels to match the blue pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green channel -&amp;gt; Set the blue and red pixels to match the green pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum -&amp;gt; Set the values of the pixel to match the largest value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum -&amp;gt; Set the values of the pixel to match the smallest value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
