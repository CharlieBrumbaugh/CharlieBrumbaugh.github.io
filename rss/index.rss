It's not a huge peak, but it is very prominent, and very easy to see for a really long ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the others had a school function and so we did not get started driving until around midnight. It was proably an hour and a half drive, and it turned out that the directions I had did not account for a road being closed. Eventually we gave up trying to find it in the dark and slept in the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we woke up, we had an awesome view of the peak which had a large lenticular cloud streaming past the summit. We decided to attempt to climb it from the east side, starting out at a Boy Scout camp and then just heading up (the trail was on the other side of the mountain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we had a small mountain to climb with a firewatching tower on top, where we stopped and had lunch. Then we went back down that mountain, finding a large bull snake about halfway down, before finally heading up Laramie Peak. We stuck to the top of the easternmost ridge, weaving our way up around various dead logs and rock outcroppings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we decide that if we were not at the top by 5:30 pm we would have to turn around regardless. When 5:30 pm came, we were within a mile and 1,000 vertical feet of the top, but it was starting to snow and we headed back down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half a mile from the saddle between Laramie Peak and the little mountain, I turned around and looked back up and there was a blanket of fog heading down the mountain towards us. Very shortly there was a blanket of fog coming down the small mountain ahead of us as well. We reached the saddle just as it got dark, and the fog reached us about the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night is a blur of hiking in the dark, dehydrated, out of food and crossing rock slabs of uncertain height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually made it all the way back to the vehicle and from there back to school. It was one heck of an epic adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning I woke and packed a light daypack and headed up the south side of the canyon, scrambling up small boulders and the winding my around until I was out of the canyon, onto the west side of the mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started it was all sagebrush and juniper, as I got higher up, it turned to spruce and aspen on the north side of the ridge, while the south facing side was completely bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw probably 20-30 mountain goats and passed quite a number of trees that had been initialed by sheepherders back in the early 1920-30 which I found rather interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I got out of the trees completely and got to the final leg of the climb where I had to kick steps in the snow in order to ascend. Upon reaching the top, I sent a message with my inReach and took a number of photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way off the peak I was able to glissade for a little bit, and then it was back to slogging through the brush all over again. Instead of going the long way back, I descended directly into the canyon to the south, in order to walk back on the road that went through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw several grouse on the way down and then old mining cabins and tailings on my hike down the road back to my vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get out and do some big adventures and this seemed like an awesome way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, I began in Cheyenne, stocking up on food in Laramie and then driving across Wyoming to Salt Lake city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there I stopped at a park to see and old friend and we hung out and talked for quite a while, not having seen the other in over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I drove south and ended up sleeping in my car in an empty parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

The short version is that in a color image, there are different RGB (Red,Green,Blue) values for each pixel, while in a B&amp;amp;W image the RGB values for each pixel are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the RGB values for a pixel in a color image might be 200,100,50 and if one was to convert it to a red channel B&amp;amp;W, you would set the values of the pixel to 200,200,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the simpler B&amp;amp;W algorithms include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red channel -&amp;gt; Set the blue and green pixels to match the red pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue channel -&amp;gt; Set the red and green pixels to match the blue pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green channel -&amp;gt; Set the blue and red pixels to match the green pixels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum -&amp;gt; Set the values of the pixel to match the largest value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum -&amp;gt; Set the values of the pixel to match the smallest value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
